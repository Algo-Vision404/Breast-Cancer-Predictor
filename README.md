# Breast Cancer Predictor

Breast Cancer Predictor is a machine learning application that classifies breast tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using cytology lab data. The project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can support **early detection** and improve healthcare decision-making.

## Features
- Predicts tumor type (benign or malignant) from medical measurements  
- Interactive **Streamlit web app** for real-time input and predictions  
- Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training pipeline  
- Visualizations for data insights and model evaluation  

---
## Dataset
The model is trained on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

## App preview
You can also check out the live app on 


## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Streamlit** (user interface)  
- **Plotly** (visualization)  
- **Git & GitHub** (version control)
